Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5207

Known Issues & Workarounds
--------------------------
The fabric-ccenv image which is used to build chaincode, currently includes
the github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim ("shim") package.
This is convenient, as it provides the ability to package chaincode
without the need to include the "shim". However, this may cause issues in future
releases (and/or when trying to use packages which are included by the "shim").

In order to avoid any issues, users are advised to manually vendor the "shim"
package with their chaincode prior to using the peer CLI for packaging and/or
for installing chaincode.

Please refer to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5177 for more details,
and kindly be aware that given the above, we may end up changing the
fabric-ccenv in the future.

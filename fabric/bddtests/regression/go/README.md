OTE is the Orderer Traffic Engine application that
launches a network as specified with environment variable parameters,
creates Producer clients to broadcast transactions to all channels on
all orderers,
creates Consumer clients to deliver/receive batches of transactions,
and counts and reports all results.

TDK is the Test Development Kit application test tool and suite of tests for
high level system testing with an eye towards consensus and reliability.
This tool is still under development; it requires enhancements to be converted
from v0.6 to v1.0 interfaces.

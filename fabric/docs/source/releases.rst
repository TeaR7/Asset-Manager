Release Notes
=============

`v1.0.6 <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.0.6>`__
February 18, 2018

Bug fixes, documentation and test coverage improvements, UX improvements
based on user feedback and changes to address a variety of static scan
findings (unused code, static security scanning, spelling, linting and more).

Known Vulnerabilities
none

Resolved Vulnerabilities
none

Known Issues & Workarounds
The fabric-ccenv image which is used to build chaincode, currently includes
the github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim ("shim") package.
This is convenient, as it provides the ability to package chaincode
without the need to include the "shim". However, this may cause issues in future
releases (and/or when trying to use packages which are included by the "shim").

In order to avoid any issues, users are advised to manually vendor the "shim"
package with their chaincode prior to using the peer CLI for packaging and/or
for installing chaincode.

Please refer to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5177 for more details,
and kindly be aware that given the above, we may end up changing the
fabric-ccenv in the future.

Known Issues & Workarounds

BCCSP content in the configtx.yaml has been `removed <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/a997c30>`__. This change will cause a panic when running `configtxgen` tool with a configtx.yaml file that includes the removed BCCSP content.

Java Chaincode support has been disabled until post 1.0.0 as it is not yet fully mature. It may be re-enabled for experimentation by cloning the hyperledger/fabric repository, reversing `this commit <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/29e0c40>`__ and building your own fork.
